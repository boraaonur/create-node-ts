# Minimalistic Node.js with TypeScript Starter

I often found myself needing a simple Node.js setup with TypeScript support. While there are many Node.js TypeScript starters out there, many come bundled with extra configurations and tools, like Prettier and Jest, which aren't always necessary for simpler projects. This repository is my personal template for a basic Node.js project that integrates TypeScript. The only additional configuration it has is for nodemon.

I've created this primarily for my own use, but if you find it useful, you're welcome to use it as well.

## How to Use:
You can initialize a new project with this template by using:
```
npx boraaonur/create-node-ts
```

Or if the above doesn't work:
```
npm exec boraaonur/create-node-ts
```

Feel free to fork this repository if you'd like to make changes tailored to your needs.# create-node-ts
